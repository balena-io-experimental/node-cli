# node-cli

My experiments in learning to use Node for CLI applications.

# What's here

* `hello`: Simple "hello, world" application

* `upgrade-supervisor`: Experiment to see if I can trigger a supervisor update.

* `alog`: Experiment to see if I can display a device's logs, broken out by service, on the command line in a tmux-like manner.
